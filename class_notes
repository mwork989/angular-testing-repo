Angular uses Jasmine as its testing framework and Karma as its test runner.


The Angular CLI sets up the testing environment for you automatically when you create a new project. The primary utility used in Angular unit tests is the TestBed which lets you configure and create components and services in a test environment.


npm run test --> pakage.json --> angular cli based command -->  ng test

ng test configured in angular .json --> tsconfig.spec.jon --> identifies all the spec files inside src and convert it from TS to JS
